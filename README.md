# Feed Reader Testing

This is the fifth required project on the [Udacity Front End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The objective of this project is to learn about test-driven and behavior-driven development, by using the JavaScript testing framework **[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)**.

### Project requirements

The project needs to follow this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view).

### How to Run

To run the project locally, [clone](https://github.com/mairamartinsk/feedreader.git
) this repo or download a [zip file](https://github.com/mairamartinsk/feedreader/archive/master.zip). Once all files are downloaded and/or extracted to a local folder, open **index.html** on your preferred internet browser.

The index file loads the *feed reader app*. Scroll down to find the Jasmine suite of tests. If all tests are running correctly, the specified items will be displayed in **green**. If any errors are present, the tests will be displayed in **red**.
